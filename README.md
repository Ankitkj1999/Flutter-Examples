# Flutter Flash Light Example App

### In this flutter app I have made a flash light example app using the following flutter packages:
<ul>
<li><i>torch_light</i></li>
<li><i>day_night_switcher</i></li>
<li><i>url_launcher</i></li>
<li><i>flutter_native_splach</i></li>

</ul>

> ### Learnings from this app would be :
> 1. Implemtaion of conditioal statement in many places as we have changed the color and image in many places by checking the when the dark mode if on or not.
> 2. Implemneted native splash screen.
> 3. Used the flshlight feature.
